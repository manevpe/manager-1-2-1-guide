This page provides a short guideline and ideas on how to do manager one to one meetings with direct reports.

## Overview and Purpose of 1-2-1 meetings:
The purpose of 1-2-1 meetings is to make sure your direct reports are happy, motivated and doing their job to the best of their ability.
It is an essential tool to discover and remove issues and obstacles early on, align your goals, vision and strategy, and help your reports develop their skills and grow in your organization.
The 1-2-1 meeting is the easiest way to notice and prevent people churning. If a person has decided that it is time to leave the organization, it is already too late to prevent it. This is why it is essential to notice any demotivation in it's early stages and address the issue on time. This is the only way to keep good people on the team.
Make sure your direct reports are comfprtable discussing topics with you. You need to create a safe environment where you can calmly discuss both happy and negative topics without fear of any reprecaution. Make sure they are aware that they should raise anything bothering them, to you, as this is the only way to remove the problem. Your direct reports need to know that you are open the discussion issues.

There isn't one best management style. Figure out how someone wants to be managed in your initial one on one:
 - What did you like about your previous manager? What didn't you like?
 - What do you like to see from a manager?

## Desired Outcome:
Every good meeting should have an outcome, than you try to achieve.
The outcome from 1-2-1 meetings with your direct reports can be different, depending on the situation.
Here are a few examples:
 - build rapport
 - discuss ongoing challenges and issues
 - provide and receive feedback
 - discuss goals and progress
 - motivation
 - share, discuss and align on company/team vision, plans, strategy

You don't have to cover each of these topics every time, but make sure you don't postpone anyone for too long. For example, you might give and receive feedback every 3 months or so, but don't postpone it for more than an year.

Here is a good chart of what people value in their work - you can use it as an inspiration to define expected outcomes of your 1-2-1 meetings:

## Dos
Prepare your questions and topics in advance
Make notes during or after the meeting.
Make action plans for the next meeting. Do check in on them.
Do make sure people feel comfortable to share their opinion freely and ask any question.
Do leave the other person to talk more than you. 
Do share on your own - you can't expect only the other person to share. 

---

## Don'ts:
Don't skip the meeting without a good reason.
Don't use the 1-2-1 meeting as a status report - you should utilize the time for more personal discusssions, and less about progress on current tasks.
Don't steal the conversation - you should be predominently listening and asking questions.
Don't make people wait for your 1-2-1 meeting if they have something they would like to discuss right now. Postponing the conversation can hide a potential problem.

---

## Frequency:
This can depend on the person and the situation. Some people are looking forward to frequend check-in, while others can be bothered by too frequent meetings.
Working in the same space or fully remotely can also have an affect on how frequently you will need to meet 1-2-1 with your reports.
In general, start with a touch base on a weekly basis. If you feel, this is too often, extend the time to bi-weekly or even more. But don't go for more than 1 month without a 1-2-1 meeting.
Monthly check-in is also a good idea for skip level 1-2-1s, if you have other managers reporting to you.

## Topics and Questions:
Try to prepare for each 1-2-1 meeting, by picking a couple of the topics / questions below.
Try to use open ended questions, that stimulate people to open up. Example - two ways of asking the same question - open and close ended:
 - (close eneded) Do you like working in the company?
 - (open ended) What do you like about working in the company?
On the former question, a shy person could just answer "Yes" or "No". On the later question, they are inclined to think of something and elaborate.
Open ended questions usually start with the 5 Ws - "What", "When", "Where", "Who", "Why" or "How".

### Build Rapport:
 - Interests and hobbies outside of work.
 - Family and private life - vacation plans, pets, children, etc. Be carefull - not everyone is ok to share details of their private life. Don't be pushy if the person is uncomfortable with a such discussion. Try to predispose them by sharing details of your own personal life.

### Provide and Receive Feedback:
This is usually discussed in more detail on a performance review meeting, but you should not ignore or postpone any recent feedback you have, especially, if it can be used to correct a behaviour in a timely manner.

 - What do you feel I should change in my work/communication/etc?
 - Discuss recent success and highlight good behavior.
 - How do you feel about the amount of feedback you are getting?

The 1-2-1 meetings are a good time to discuss and align on company vision and plans. You can use the time to make sure your direct reports are clear on the direction the company is moving and your whole team is in agreement that this is the right way forward.
 - Are you clear on the company vision and plans?
 - Do you feel the company is moving in the right direction?

### 1-2-1s with Managers Reporting to You:
One on ones where the report is also a manager are typically more "business" where the focus is on strategy, team health and project alignment.
Make sure to talk both about themself and about their team.
Some example questions about how they are managing their own team:
 - Who is the most important person on your team? Why?
 - Who is the most motivated? Who is the least motivated?
 - What motivates your team?
 - How would you describe the working culture in your team?
 - Tell me about the last time your team did a fun activity together outside of work?
 - How would you rate the team motivation and happiness right now? What can be done to improve it?
 - What could we do to improve the productivity of the team? What is the biggest obstacle?
 - What is the last milestone / achievement your team did? How did you recognize / celebrate it?
 - What is the workload on your team?
 - Is there somebody who is not pulling their own weight at the moment?

## Skip-level 1-2-1s:
Skip-level meetings are done when you have another people manager reporting into you, and you meet with his direct reports - effectively skipping one level down.
They can be useful to provide contact with a high-level management to a broader part of the organization. They can also make people feel appreciated and valued.
Another useful case for skip-level meetings is when you have a new manager reporting into you, and you need to make sure he is doing a good job as a manager.
Skip-level meetings are in general less frequent than meetings with direct reports.
