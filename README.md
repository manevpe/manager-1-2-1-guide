# Manager 1-2-1 Meeting Guide
This page provides a short guideline and ideas on how to do manager 1-2-1 meetings with direct reports.
It can be useful for both inexperienced people managers, as well as for seasoned ones.


## Overview and Purpose of 1-2-1 meetings:
The purpose of 1-2-1 meetings is to make sure your direct reports are happy, motivated and doing their job to the best of their ability.
It is an essential tool to discover and remove issues and obstacles early on, align your goals, vision and strategy, and help your reports develop their skills and grow in your organization.
The 1-2-1 meeting is the easiest way to notice and prevent people churning. If a person has decided that it is time to leave the organization, it is already too late to prevent it. This is why it is essential to notice any demotivation in it's early stages and address the issue on time. This is the only way to keep good people on the team.
Make sure your direct reports are comfprtable discussing topics with you. You need to create a safe environment where you can calmly discuss both happy and negative topics without fear of any reprecaution. Make sure they are aware that they should raise anything bothering them, to you, as this is the only way to remove the problem. Your direct reports need to know that you are open the discussion issues.


## Desired Outcome:
Every good meeting should have an outcome, than you try to achieve.
The outcome from 1-2-1 meetings with your direct reports can be different, depending on the situation.
Here are a few examples:
 - build rapport
 - discuss ongoing challenges and issues
 - provide and receive feedback
 - discuss goals and progress
 - motivation
 - share, discuss and align on company/team vision, plans, strategy

You don't have to cover each of these topics every time, but make sure you don't postpone anyone for too long. For example, you might give and receive feedback every 3 months or so, but don't postpone it for more than an year.

Here is a good chart of what people value in their work - you can use it as an inspiration to define expected outcomes of your 1-2-1 meetings:

## What Not to Do:
The 1-2-1 meeting should not be used as a status report - you should utilize the time for more personal discusssions, and less about progress on current tasks.
Don't steal the conversation - you should be predominently listening and asking questions.
Don't make people wait for your 1-2-1 meeting if they have something they would like to discuss right now. Postponing the conversation can hide a potential problem.


## Frequency:
This can depend on the person and the situation. Some people are looking forward to frequend check-in, while others can be bothered by too frequent meetings.
Working in the same space or fully remotely can also have an affect on how frequently you will need to meet 1-2-1 with your reports.
In general, start with a touch base on a weekly basis. If you feel, this is too often, extend the time to bi-weekly or even more. But don't go for more than 1 month without a 1-2-1 meeting.
Monthly check-in is also a good idea for skip level 1-2-1s, if you have other managers reporting to you.


## Topics and Questions:
Try to prepare for each 1-2-1 meeting, by picking a couple of the topics / questions below.
Try to use open ended questions, that stimulate people to open up. Example - two ways of asking the same question - open and close ended:
 - (close eneded) Do you like working in the company?
 - (open ended) What do you like about working in the company?
On the former question, a shy person could just answer "Yes" or "No". On the later question, they are inclined to think of something and elaborate.
Open ended questions usually start with the 5 Ws - "What", "When", "Where", "Who", "Why" or "How".


### Build Rapport:
 - Interests and hobbies outside of work.
 - Family and private life - vacation plans, pets, children, etc. Be carefull - not everyone is ok to share details of their private life. Don't be pushy if the person is uncomfortable with a such discussion. Try to predispose them by sharing details of your own personal life.
 - Tell me about an interesting thing that happened to you in the past (week).
 - What do you thing of the last / next team event?

### Challenges and Issues:
 - Do you currently have any challenges in your work?
 - Anything I can help you with?
 - Anything I can do to make your work easier?
 - How do you get along with the other members in the team?
 - Anything you believe we should change?
 - What tools and resources would help you do better?

### Provide and Receive Feedback:
This is usually discussed in more detail on a performance review meeting, but you should not ignore or postpone any recent feedback you have, especially, if it can be used to correct a behaviour in a timely manner.
 - What feedback do you have for me?
 - What do you feel I should change in my work/communication/etc?
 - Discuss recent success and highlight good behavior.

### Goals and Progress:
 - What do you like about your job?
 - What do you not like about it?
 - What would you like to do more often?
 - One year from now, if you look back - what would you like to have achieved?
 - How are you progressing on your goals? What is preventing / hindering your performance?
 - What would you like to do differently?


### Motivation:
This can be tricky, as different people are motivated by different things in different moments. As people change, so do their priorities and motivation.
This is why it is crucial to keep track and adjust. Finding out what motivates and what demotivates the different people in your team will make you a great leader.
 - What is challenging you at the moment?
 - How motivated do you feel?
 - How good do you think you communicate / work with your colleagues?
 - What do you feel proud about doing in the past (month)? What are you not proud about?
 - How productive do you feel? How can this be improved?


### Company Vision, Plans, Strategy:

## Skip-level 1-2-1s:
Skip-level meetings are done when you have another people manager reporting into you, and you meet with his direct reports - effectively skipping one level down.
They can be useful to provide contact with a high-level management to a broader part of the organization. They can also make people feel appreciated and valued.
Another useful case for skip-level meetings is when you have a new manager reporting into you, and you need to make sure he is doing a good job as a manager.
Skip-level meetings are in general less frequent than meetings with direct reports.
